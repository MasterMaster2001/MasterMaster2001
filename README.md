## <span style="color:red">Introduction:</span>

* * *
The goal of the homework is to create an application to manage you tasks. It should have all the features of main application such as menues, actions and toolbar. The application must store an archive of all the pending and finished tasks.

* * *

## <span style="color:red">Use Cases:</span>

* * *
Here is a list of **cases** that the user could **perform** with our app:

**1**-A user should be able to **close** the application of course.

**2**-A Todo application cannot be useful, unless it offers the possibility of **creating new tasks**.
The essential components of a task will be defined later

**3**-The View of the main widget should be **split** in **three** areas:

**A**-The first (en persistent) area shows the list of **today** tasks.

**B**-The second one is reserved for **pending** task (tasks for the future).

**C**-Finally, the third one shows the set of **finished** tasks.

**4**-Each category must be shown with a custom icon.

**5**-The user could either hide/show the pending and finished views.

**6**-Finally, the tasks entered to your application must remains in the app in future use.
